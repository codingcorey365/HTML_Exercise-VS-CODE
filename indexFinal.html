            <p>Hey, my name is Corey. I am current enrolled in TrueCoders bootcamp for Software Engineering. I am looking forward to break into this career field this month after graduation. I have truly enjoyed learning how to program, and plan to get a degree in computer science in the future. While this may have been one of the hardest things I have done, I will say it is equally the best thing I could have done for myself. </p>

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I asked. "The
        <strong>point</strong>,"  <span>Brendon</span> said grandly, "is to <U>play</U> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted
        his hands and shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why
        would I want to win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
